The source code is ISC licensed. The ISC license is registered with and
approved by the Open Source Initiative. Here's what it might look like:

    * Copyright (c) 2012 Some person <s.person@example.org>
    * Copyright (c) 2012 Another person <a.person@example.org>
    *
    * Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for
    * any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the
    * above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.

There are many reasons why this license is used here, with these being the
foremost:

    1. It is simple.
    2. It is essentially non-political.
    3. It encourages code reuse.


THE ISC LICENSE AND CODE REUSE
These copyright and permission notices appear in every source code file 
of this project. Though it permits almost anything, please note that you 
are not allowed to remove or modify these notices in any derivative 
works, though you should add your name to the list of copyright holders, 
if you choose to use the same license. 

When reusing ISC licensed code, in code distributed under some other 
license, these notices must be present in the resulting code, documentation
and binaries. When copying or reusing parts of the code, rather than copying
whole files, you are required to also copy these notices. You may not
relicense the code.


MIXING WITH OTHER LICENSES
The ISC license is extremely permissive. It allows reusing code in any
open or closed source project. ISC licensed code will peacefully coexist
with code licensed under any other license known, as long as the copyright
and permission notices are neither modified nor removed.

If you reuse this code under a copyleft license like the GPL, please 
appreciate that your GPL licensed improvements to this code, cannot go
back into this project, as it would require relicensing the whole project
under your copyleft license. Please consider dual licensing your changes,
whether you use the GPL or any other closed or open source license.

You can allow us to use your code under the ISC (or equivalent) license
by including a notice either in your source tree, if it is publicly
available, or by sending an email to <h-vhs@huggpunkt.org> allowing
us to use those parts of your code which are based on this project under
the ISC license.

This project will always be licensed under the ISC or any functionally
equivalent license.
