This repository contains a full rewrite and the next version of H.VHS,
while the previous, unfortunately quite broken version is still hosted
at Google Code. (http://code.google.com/p/huggpunktplay)

The LICENSING file contains information on not only the ISC license 
used in this project and what the licensing terms means for code reuse,
but also on WHY the nature of this project gives good reason to use it.

The purpose of this software is to make downloading content from the 
video streaming sites of (not only) commercial and public service 
broadcasting companies easy and available to the general public. This is 
indeed legal in many (or most?) countries, including Sweden where this
project is based. There is even a governmental system in place where 
a percentage of what one pays for DVD:s, hard drives and other writable 
media is distributed to copyright holders, to compensate for economic
losses attributed to recording or downloading of copyrighted content,
when it is made available legally, and sharing such content amongst
relatives and close friends.

Please also note that it is not legal, at least not in Sweden, to record
or download copyrighted content made available illegally (i.e. without the
copyright holders permission). This, however, is only marginally relevant
to this project, as it is specifically aimed only at downloading content
made available legally.

The purpose of this software IS NOT to facilitate copyright 
infringement, and any contributions aimed to adapt the software 
specifically to such a purpose will not be included. Please do not 
confuse this project with pirate activity.
