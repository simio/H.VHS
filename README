This repository contains a full rewrite and the next version of H.VHS,
while the previous, unfortunately quite broken version is still hosted
at Google Code. (http://code.google.com/p/huggpunktplay)

The H.VHS home page is currently only available in Swedish:

The LICENSING file contains information on not only the ISC license 
used in this project and what the licensing terms means for code reuse,
but also on WHY the nature of this project gives good reason to use it.
